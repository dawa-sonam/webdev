    The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first
    referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going Merry,
    their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built
    them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.
